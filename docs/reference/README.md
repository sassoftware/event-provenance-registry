# Reference Documentation

## Overview

Reference documentation should be information oriented. They should represent
the technical descriptions of the machinery and how to run it. How to use Key
classes, functions, and APIs. Reference material explains things like "this is
how you create a model". In reference documentation we can list things with
explanations of what they are (glossary). Reference documentation should not
describe how to solve a problem. Think of an encyclopedia entry about a recipe.
Consistency and Structure matter (like a dictionary). The only job is
description of the machinery.

## Sections

### Tutorials

Tutorials are learning oriented. The idea is to get the users started with
practical steps.

### How-tos

The how-to guides are problem/solution oriented. They take the reader through a
series of steps to solve a specific problem or create a solution.

### References

Reference documentation is information oriented. They represent the technical
descriptions of the machinery and how to run it. How to use Key classes,
functions, and APIs. Reference material explains things like "this is how the
GraphQL front end works".

### Explanations

Explanations are understanding oriented. They discuss the background and context
of the architecture, decisions made, research that was done, and the pros and
cons of things. Discussions explain why things are the way they are.
